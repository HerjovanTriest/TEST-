# Testing
This is a test to see if anyone can try and commit changes from Github to Sarax Gitbook. 
It seems like it is working, so a system we could use is setup a folder in the Sarax Github and upload the Gitbook to the Github.
I will try to explain this to Ayham as he is the admin. Might be good to do when the site is more or less layed out. 
This will also give a space to attach the URL to the site in the Github
