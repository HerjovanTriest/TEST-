# Carbon Fibre Cutting

<details>

<summary>What is Carbon Fibre</summary>

Carbon fiber is a material consisting of thin, strong crystalline filaments of carbon, essentially carbon atoms bonded together in long chains. The fibers are extremely stiff, strong, and light, and are used in many processes to create excellent structural materials. Carbon fiber offers a variety of benefits including:

* High stiffness and stiffness-to-weight ratio
* High tensile strength and strength-to-weight ratio
* High-temperature tolerance with special resins
* Low thermal expansion
* High chemical resistance

### What Does Carbon Fiber Look Like? <a href="#what-does-carbon-fiber-look-like" id="what-does-carbon-fiber-look-like"></a>

Carbon fiber is made in black strands or yarns called "Tows" and comes in a variety of formats, including spools of tow, unidirectional formats, weaves, braids, and others, which are used to create carbon fiber composite parts.

Within each of these formats are sub-categories of further refinement. For example, different carbon fiber weaves can result in different properties in the composite part.

### What Material is Carbon Fiber?

Carbon fiber is a material made from thin filaments of carbon atoms bonded together in a crystalline structure, which results in an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. The manufacture of carbon fiber material involves several complex steps that transform carbon-rich precursors into spools of fibers.

Most carbon fibers are produced using polyacrylonitrile (PAN), pitch, or rayon as the precursor. The selected precursor material is first spun to create long fibers. The raw fibers are then heated in an oxygen-free environment in a process called stabilization to prevent them from burning or shrinking. After stabilization, the fibers are carbonized at a very high temperature of around 1000 - 3000 degrees Celsius in an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen. This drives out almost all non-carbon elements from the fibers leaving behind almost pure carbon atoms in a crystalline structure. Finally, the fibers receive a surface treatment to enhance their adhesion to matrix materials and then wound onto spools.

### Creating Carbon Fiber Composites <a href="#creating-carbon-fiber-composites" id="creating-carbon-fiber-composites"></a>

To create a composite part, the carbon fibers, which are stiff in tension and compression, need to be supported in a stable matrix to maintain the part shape. Epoxy resin is an excellent plastic with good physical properties and is often used for this matrix, with carbon fibers providing strength.

Since both epoxy and carbon fiber are low-density, one can create a part that is lightweight, but very strong. When fabricating a composite part, a multitude of different processes can be utilized, including wet-layup, vacuum bagging, resin transfer, matched tooling, insert molding, pultrusion, and many other methods. In addition, the selection of the resin allows for tailoring specific properties such as elevated temperature or chemical resistance.

### Preperations

Cutting carbon fiber can be a difficult task without the right equipment. This post will help you cut your carbon fiber parts with low cost tools (some that you may already have in your garage), and do it without messing up the carbon fiber sheet you just bought.

#### Saftey First – Use Protection

Carbon fiber dust is an irritant and can cause itching if gets on your skin or difficulty breathing if you inhale it. Proper safety equipment will help prevent this. The following PPE is recommended.

* Long sleeves or a Tyvek paint suit.
* Gloves.
* Dust mask or respirator.
* Good ventilation, with using a shop vacuum or using a downdraft table to collect the dust being better.
* Eye protection

#### Preparation

Spending a little time up front for good preparation is an important part of producing quality parts, and it will save time and frustration later. These following tips will help.

* Tape Measure, remember to measure twice and cut once!
* Masking or painter’s tape, good for outlining where to cut, or allowing you to make more precise marks
* Marking tool, a metallic silver Sharpie works great directly on the carbon fiber, or you can use a pen or pencil on top of the masking tape
* Backing material helps get nice parts and reduce backside blow-out and splintering. You can use wood or rigid foam insulation to clamp your carbon fiber sheet to.

#### Method #1 - Hand Saws

A metal cutting blade on a handsaw will work well for cutting straight lines in carbon fiber. Even though the blade will dull quickly they are low cost and get the job done. You want to select a blade with a higher TPI (teeth per inch) this will give you a better cut.&#x20;

#### Method #2 - Rotary Tool

If you have a rotary cutting tool such as a Dremel, this is a great starting point for cutting carbon fiber. A standard abrasive metal cutting wheel works, but it will degrade quickly. If you are doing a lot of cutting you will be better off getting a diamond coated cutting wheel that is used for cutting tile. They are more expensive, but they will hold up much longer.

### How to cut carbon tubes?

#### Step 1 : Make sure to wear PPE.

#### Step 2: Clamp the tube.

Clamp the tube in a vice, make sure to support both sides.&#x20;

#### Step 3: Measure the tubes to size

Using a measuring tape measure the size of rod you want. Tape this section and mark it with a sharpie. The taping will help prevent delamanation when sawing.

#### Step 4: Saw around the tube

Make a shallow cut around the rod. This will help the saw blade staying straight.

#### Step 5: Saw through the tube

Be gentle and take your time sawing through the carbon tube. When too much force is used, delamination can occur.&#x20;

### How to sand carbon tubes?

#### Step 1: Make sure to wear PPE.

#### Step 2: Clamp the tube.

Clamp the tube using a vice.&#x20;

#### Step 3: Sand to size.&#x20;

Use sandpaper to carefully sand the tube to the desired size. Go slowly to prevent excessive heat, which can melt the polymer in carbon fiber. Ensure the edges are sand down straight.

#### Step 4: Sand the edge.&#x20;

For deburring the edge of the rod, 200 grit sandpaper can be inserted in the tube at an 45 degree angle. This will make a small chamfer. Do this on the outside as well.&#x20;
