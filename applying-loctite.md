# Applying Loctite

<details>

<summary>What is Loctite</summary>

**Loctite Threadlocker** is an adhesive designed to fill the gaps between threaded metal components, curing to form a solid, thermoset plastic. This prevents loosening, leakage, and corrosion caused by vibrations and other external forces.

#### Curing Time

The drying time of threadlocker varies based on several factors, including:

* **Type of Threadlocker**: Different formulations have varying curing speeds.
* **Ambient Conditions**: Temperature and humidity can impact curing time.
* **Materials**: The substrates being bonded also play a role in the curing process.

Typically, full curing can take **24 to 36 hours**, with handling cure times ranging from **1.5 to 30 minutes** depending on the threadlocker type and strength.

#### Essential Properties

Threadlockers should exhibit the following characteristics:

* **Fast Cure Speed**: Quick curing at room temperature.
* **Chemical Compatibility**: Resistant to acids, alkalis, and solvents.
* **Vibration Resistance**: Effectively prevents loosening under vibration.
* **Good Consistency**: Ensures even application.

Liquid threadlockers are favored for their ease of application and ability to penetrate threaded surfaces effectively.

#### Selection Guide

When selecting a threadlocker, consider the following criteria:

1. **Media Compatibility**: Ensure the threadlocker is chemically compatible with the materials it will contact. Common compatible materials include:
   * **Metals**: Steel and aluminum.
   * **Plastics**: Nylon and polycarbonate.
   * **Fluids**: Oils, lubricants, and solvents.
2. **Curing Speed**: Select a threadlocker based on how quickly it needs to cure for your application.
3. **Approvals**: Look for certifications relevant to your use case:
   * **Gas Applications**: Low-strength Loxeal and high-strength Loctite threadlockers may have gas application approvals.
   * **Food and Water Safety**: ANSI/NSF certifications indicate compatibility with drinking water and food contact.
4. **Temperature Resistance**: High-temperature threadlockers are available for applications exposed to elevated temperatures.
5. **Strength Requirements**:
   * **Low Strength**: Allows disassembly with minimal force—ideal for frequently adjusted fasteners.
   * **Medium Strength**: Balances holding power and removability; can be disassembled with standard tools.
   * **High Strength**: Permanently locks fasteners, requiring specialized chemicals for removal.

#### Recommended Application

For this application, **Blue Loctite** (a medium-strength threadlocker) is chosen. It provides adequate holding power while allowing the nuts to be undone by hand if necessary, making it suitable for applications requiring occasional adjustments.

## How to apply Loctite:

#### 1. Prepare the surface

Preparation is often overlooked but crucial for threadlocker performance and longevity. Fasteners in manufacturing may have a corrosion inhibitor coating that must be removed with a suitable cleaner. Neglecting this can hinder the curing process. In maintenance and repairs, contaminants like grease and dust can impede the threadlocker; clean threads are essential. Effective cleaning and prep ensure optimal mechanical, thermal, and chemical performance of the threadlocker.

#### 2. Allow the threads to dry

After cleaning, give the threads enough time to dry fully, ensuring there’s no trace of the cleaners you’ve used on surfaces that are going to be bonded.

Once both surfaces are completely dry, you can apply the threadlocker for the strongest possible bond.

#### 3. Apply a few drops of threadlocker

A little threadlocker goes a long way. The most important rule to remember is that you only need to focus on the area where the two threads will join when bonded to ensure maximum performance.

But one of the most common mistakes people make is to use too much. This can overfill the thread, leading to messy applications and overflowing assemblies.

When deciding how much threadlocker to apply, focus on where the thread and nut will be seated (locked in place) when assembled. Apply a few drops of your chosen threadlocker across this area.\


As your bolt turns, this will spread across the desired area, leaving you with a strong bond. Make sure there’s an even spread across the surface you’re applying the adhesive to.

Once you have applied your threadlocker, slowly turn the nut to allow the adhesive to spread evenly across the two threads until everything is locked in place.

#### 5. Cure in place

The final crucial stage of using threadlockers is curing. Most LOCTITE threadlockers take 24 hours to fully cure, undergoing an anaerobic chemical reaction from liquid to solid polymer. Allowing complete curing is essential for optimal performance, as premature use can hinder the adhesive from reaching its full mechanical and physical properties. In maintenance scenarios requiring quick machinery recovery, you can use the equipment once the threadlocker's fixture time of 30 minutes has passed
