# Crimping

<details>

<summary>What is crimping?</summary>

Crimping is conducted using a manual or [automatic crimp tool](https://tri-star-technologies.com/product-category/automated-crimpers/), which effectively installs a connector to the end of a wire. After placing an unattached connector and exposed wire into the crimping tool, the device bonds the components, allowing for air-tight connection to other cables. Automatic crimpers are useful for more industrial applications, as they can crimp larger quantities of wires quickly and efficiently. Plus, these tools significantly reduce physical labor.

**Why crimp instead of solder?**

Crimping is a superior method of connecting wires compared to soldering for many reasons. Mainly, solder joints are less mechanically durable than non-alloy joints. Additionally, high-quality crimps are better at preventing moisture exposure to metal wires, which can cause corrosion. Lastly, itâ€™s easier to connect wires to terminals with crimping than soldering.&#x20;

## How to crimp?

#### Step 1: Get a crimping tool&#x20;

To crimp wires a crimping tool is used. The numbers on the tool show the gauge of wire the tool is usable for.&#x20;

#### Step 2: Strip the wire

Use the crimping tool with the slot pointed at above to strip a specific amount of the wire, this amount is normally about 5-10 mm. The specific amount changes with the crimp used, so it will always be mentioned in the manual.&#x20;

#### Step 3: Pull back the insullation

This will expose the copper inside, twist this copper to make it more dense.&#x20;

#### Step 4: Crimp the connector.

Slide the connector across the twisted copper and insert it into the right size die. This will always be mentioned in the manual. Press down firmly on the handle such that the crimp is crushed and thus attached to the copper wire. Don't worry about applying to much pressure, a crimp is almost impossible to "Over-crimp".

#### Step 5: Slide heatshrink over the bare connection.

Slide a piece of heatshrink bigger than the bare connection over this connection. Apply heat to the heatshrink using a soldering iron or heat gun. This will shrink the heat shrink over the connection making it isolated.&#x20;
