# Color Coding

#### Color-Coding System for Tools and Fasteners

To streamline the assembly process and minimize confusion, we’ve incorporated a **color-coding system** throughout the manual. Each tool and fastener is assigned a specific color, making it easy to identify the correct tool and hardware for each step of the build. This approach ensures efficiency, precision, and clarity during the drone assembly.

Here’s a breakdown of the colors and their corresponding tools and fasteners:

* **Red**: Hex bolts – Use the red-highlighted tool when fastening or loosening hex bolts.
* **Yellow**: Pliers – Any time pliers are needed, you’ll find yellow indications to guide you.
* **Blue**: Sizing – Whenever sizing or measurement is required, blue will indicate the appropriate tools.

Additionally, all **nuts, bolts, screws, and other fasteners** are color-coded to match the tools that should be used with them. This simplifies identification and helps avoid using the wrong tools or fasteners in your build.

By following this color-coding system, you can easily navigate the assembly instructions and ensure a smooth and efficient build process from start to finish.
